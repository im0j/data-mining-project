This project is about prediction and completion task of given 35317 recipes, 6714 ingredients and 20 cuisines. To handle these tasks, we decided to use recommendation system. Recently, with applying neural network methods into graph structures, especially graph convolutional networks(GCN) give the best performance in the recommendation tasks. However, many graph neural networks were lack of scalability due to the ineffectiveness of Laplacian matrix. To handle this issue, works such as PinSAGE and MultiSAGE based on random-walk have been done. 

In our task, there is need to consider connectivity of ingredients and cuisines represented as recipes. Therefore, we need to consider the graph which can understand the contexts; recipes. So we decided to construct heterogeneous graph consisting of three types of nodes of ingredients, recipes and cuisines rather than bi-partite graph in PinSAGE. We'll follow the contextualized multi embeddings in MultiSAGE expected to be able to consider importance of the weights in connected nodes.
